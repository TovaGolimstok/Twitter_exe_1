# Tower of Twitter - Structure Investigation

The Tower of Twitter project aims to help Twitter explore different types of structures beyond social media. Experts have suggested that Twitter should venture into the construction and real estate industry. Your task is to assist Twitter in researching various types of towers.

## Exercise Overview:

The program presents users with a menu offering two options: Option 1 and Option 2. As long as the user hasn't chosen to exit the program (Option 3), the program continues to prompt the user with these options.

- Option 1: Choose a rectangular tower.
- Option 2: Choose a triangular tower.

Upon selecting an option, the user is prompted to input the height and width of the tower. For a rectangular tower, the program calculates either the perimeter or area based on the user's input. For a triangular tower, the program offers two choices:

1. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle.
2. Print the triangle.

The program only terminates when the user selects option 3 to exit.

## Directory Structure:

The exercise is structured into three directories:

1. **Applications Directory:**
   - Contains classes related to the application logic.

2. **Functionality Directory:**
   - Contains functionality required by the classes, organized by adapted names.

3. **Tests Directory:**
   - Contains tests for the functions, organized by adapted names.

## Usage:

1. **Menu Display:**
   - The program begins by displaying a menu with three options for the user to choose from.
   - The Menu class executes the corresponding function based on the user's selection.

2. **Tower Selection:**
   - Based on the user's choice (rectangular or triangular tower), the corresponding class (Rectangular or Triangular) is activated.
   - Users input tower parameters, and calculations or actions are performed accordingly.

## Closing Notes:

The Tower of Twitter project provides an interactive way to explore different types of towers through a user-friendly interface. Users can experiment with various tower shapes and calculations while following a clear menu-driven workflow.

Enjoy exploring towers with the Tower of Twitter project!
