# Twitter_exe_1
This exercise is designed to help Twitter investigate different types of structures. The user needs to choose between a rectangle or a triangle, and then enter the parameters of their choice - the height and length of the shape. Then, if they chose a rectangle, the perimeter or area of the rectangle will be displayed according to the parameters they entered. If they chose a triangle, they will need to choose between two options: 1) calculate the perimeter of the triangle, or 2) print the triangle. The program will only close when the user enters the number 3, indicating an exit.

The exercise is implemented through three directories containing files accordingly: one directory containing all the applications (classes), another directory containing all the functionality that the classes need according to adapted names, and a third directory containing all the tests on the functions according to adapted names.

Initially, the menu displays three options for the user by executing the corresponding function from the Menu class, as long as the user has not selected the third option - exit. Then, based on the user's choice, the function from the corresponding class of their choice is activated (either the Rectangular class or the Triangular class).
